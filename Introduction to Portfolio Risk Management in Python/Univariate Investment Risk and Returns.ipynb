    "To assess the likelihood of outliers in returns, it's useful to create a histogram that displays the historical returns of a stock. By using a histogram, you can illustrate the density or frequency of returns within specific ranges. It's important to take note of the outliers on the left-hand side of the distribution, as these represent significant negative daily returns that you would want to avoid. Conversely, outliers on the right-hand side of the distribution typically represent positive events for the stock, such as a positive earnings surprise."
